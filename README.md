## ‚ú® Features

This backend supports a wide range of features designed for a comprehensive e-commerce platform:

* **Multi-Role Authentication:**
    * **Super Admin:** Manages the entire platform (categories, packages). Logs in with username/password or Google SSO.
    * **Jeweler:** Manages their own product listings. Logs in with username/password.
    * **End-User:** Browses the platform. Logs in using a passwordless mobile number and OTP flow.

* **Secure Password Management:**
    * Separate password reset flows for Super Admins (via email OTP) and Jewelers (via SMS OTP).
    * Includes account lockout mechanisms to prevent brute-force attacks.

* **Product Management:**
    * Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for product listings.
    * Supports image uploads for products.
    * Role-based access ensures Jewelers and Admins can only manage their own products.

* **Category Management:**
    * Super Admins can create, update, and delete product categories (e.g., Gold, Silver, Diamonds).
    * Ability to associate categories with multiple jewelry types (e.g., Rings, Necklaces).

* **Package Management:**
    * Super Admins can create and manage free and paid packages for different user tiers (Jewelers or End-Users).
    * Control package details like name, price, validity, and features.

* **Session Management:**
    * Secure, persistent sessions handled by `express-session` and `connect-pg-simple`.
    * Includes inactivity timeouts for enhanced security.
